# Optimization 
The repo contains project and homework code and results for Optimization part 1 and part 2 offered in MSBA at UT Austin.

## Part 1
Part 1 covers Linear programming, Binary/Integer programming, Mixed Integer programming & Non-linear programming

**Homework**
Homework contains individual assignments having multiple smaller problems on different topics. Relevant data is available but the problem statement is not.

**Projects**
Project involves a bigger business problem with required data that needs to be solved using Optimization techniques convered. Three projects were done in part 1 -
